# Commercial-only features

A commercial license is in general required when running SmartGit in a commercial environment, see sections 3.2.1 and 3.2.2 of the [license agreement](https://www.syntevo.com/documents/smartgit-license.html).

A few features of SmartGit are only available when running SmartGit with a commercial license (no guarantee on completeness):

- [Standard window](https://www.syntevo.com/smartgit/standard-window/)
- [GitHub Enterprise integration](../Integrations/GitHub-Enterprise-Integration.md)
- [Bitbucket Server (Atlassian Stash) integration](../Integrations/BitBucket-Server-Atlassian-Stash-integration.md)
- [Distributed Reviews](../AddOns/Distributed-Reviews-add-on-.md) (will require an additional add-on license)
- DeepGit license included
