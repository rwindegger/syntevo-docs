# Add-Ons to SmartGit

SmartGit provides the following optional Add-Ons which can be used to enhance your SmartGit installation:

- [Distributed Reviews Add-On](Distributed-Reviews-add-on-.md), allowing your team to comment and contribute feedback on Pull Requests.
- [Server Side Component](Server-side-component.md), which can be used to notify team members when certain Pull Request related events occur.

Both of the above Add Ons are useful in organisations where your Git remote repository hosting service does not provide a interactive Pull Request mechanism for your team.
