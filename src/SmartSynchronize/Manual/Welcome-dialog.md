# Welcome Dialog

The welcome dialog occurs when launching SmartSynchronize without specifying (all required) command line arguments.
Select what you want to do: compare files or directories, merge files or open a stored profile (a named directory compare).

## Compare
Select the *Compare* option to perform a file or directory compare.
To compare files, select the *Files* option.
To compare directories, select the *Directories* option.
Depending on this selection, clicking the chooser buttons right beside the text fields will either open the select file dialog or the select directory dialog.

With the triangle button to the right you can open the compare history allowing you to chose previously compares files or directories.
If the history button is disabled, no compare history items are present.
Selecting an history entry will set the <label>Left</label> and <label>Right</label> text fields and set the right *Files* or *Directories* option.
At the bottom of the history popup menu you can find the menu items <menuitem>Remove Obsolete Entries</menuitem> to remove history entries which are (currently) not available any more and <menuitem>Clear History</menuitem> to clear the compare history.

## 3-Way-Merge

Select the *3-Way Merge* option to perform a 3-way merge.
Use the chooser buttons right beside the text fields to open the select file dialog.

With the triangle button to the right you can open the merge history allowing you to chose previously merged files.
If the history button is disabled, no merge history items are present.
At the bottom of the history popup menu you can find the menu items <menuitem>Remove Obsolete Entries</menuitem> to remove history entries which are not available any more and <menuitem>Clear History</menuitem> to clear the merge history.

# Open Profile

To open a profile, double click it.
The *Open Profile* option will be selected automatically.
