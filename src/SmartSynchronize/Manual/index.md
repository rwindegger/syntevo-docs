SmartSynchronize is a tool to

- manage files (copy, move, rename, pack, unpack, ...),
- compare text files with the ability to edit the files and to apply changes from one file to the other,
- merge two different changes to one text file back to this file (3-way merge),
- compare directory structures with the ability to apply changes from one side to the other.

This makes it very easy to synchronize files or directory structures, for example, between your home and your office data.
