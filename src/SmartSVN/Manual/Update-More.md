# Update More

Use **Modify\|Update More** to get locally missing directories and files
from the repository for a foregoing non-recursive Update or [Check Out](Check-Out.md#CheckOut-commands.check-out) .

Update More checks for the currently selected directory whether there
are subdirectories or files that haven't been checked out yet. They are
presented in a list and you can select one or more of them to update.
**Recurse into subdirectories** specifies whether the selected entries
should be updated or checked out recursively.

To get rid of locally checked out directories, use the *inverse
operation* [Exclude from Working Copy](Exclude-from-Working-Copy.md#ExcludefromWorkingCopy-commands.update-exclude).
