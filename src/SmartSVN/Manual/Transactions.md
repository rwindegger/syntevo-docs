# Transactions

The *Transactions* are a direct view into a repositories' *Log* which is
continuously updated. The Transactions are primarily designed to keep
you up-to-date on what has happened within repositories you are
interested in, but also to allow similar powerful queries as the Log
itself. The Transactions are integrated into the [Project Window](Project-Transactions.md#ProjectTransactions-project-transactions)
and they come as a stand-alone [Transactions frame](Transactions-Frame.md#TransactionsFrame-transactions-frame).
