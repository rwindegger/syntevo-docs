# Project Manager

With the Project Manager (**Project\|Open or Manage Projects**) you can
manage your existing SmartSVN projects. The set of managed projects is
arranged in a tree-structure. This allows you to group related projects
under a common group name, etc.

With **Rename** you can change the **Name** of an already managed
project or a group. Use **Delete** to remove projects from the project
tree; neither the local directory itself nor any other filesystem
content will be affected by this operation.

You can rearrange the entries in the project tree with Drag-and-Drop. If
a group is expanded, you can move the currently selected item into this
group, otherwise it will be moved across.

Use **Create Group** to wrap the currently selected project in a group.
Thereafter you can move other projects into this group. If you
**Delete** a group, only this group will be deleted, but not contained
projects or groups.
