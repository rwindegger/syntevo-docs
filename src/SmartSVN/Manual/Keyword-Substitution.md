# Keyword Substitution

Use **Properties\|Keyword Substitution** to select the keywords for the
selected files, which should be substituted (expanded) locally. Keyword
substitution only works for text files.

For each keyword you have the option to **Set** or **Unset** it. Select
**Don't change** to keep the current substitution for the keyword.
