# Copy/Move (Repository)

Use **Modify\|Copy** or **Modify\|Move** to copy or move the selected
files/directory to another location. Select **Copy** to only copy the
files/directory or **Move** to additionally remove the copy sources
afterwards.

Use **To** to copy the copy sources itself to the selected location.
When having selected one file/directory the entered destination location
must not yet exist. The last part of the destination path will be the
new name of the copied file/directory. When having multiple files
selected, the files will be copied into the destination path.

Use **Contents Into** to copy the contents of the copy source into the
selected location. This option is only available for copying
directories. In either case, necessary parent directories will be
created automatically.

Enter the corresponding **Commit Message** which is automatically
suggested, as long as you don't have manually modified it. Select
**After command execution show repository at HEAD revision** to reset
the Repository Browser's revision to HEAD after having performed the
copy or move command. This option is only available if the current
revision not set to HEAD and it is convenient to immediately see the
copy results (in HEAD).
