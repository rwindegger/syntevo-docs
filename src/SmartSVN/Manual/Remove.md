# Remove

Use **Modify\|Remove** to schedule the selected files/directory for
removal from SVN control.

Select **Remove from SVN control and delete locally** to schedule the
files/directory for removal and to also delete them locally. Select
**Just remove from SVN control** to schedule for removal only. After
committing the changes, the files/directories will remain as
unversioned.

By default, SmartSVN refuses to remove files or directories that have
local modifications, as well as directories that contain modified or
unversioned files. Select **Force Removal** if you wish to perform the
removal of such items anyway.
