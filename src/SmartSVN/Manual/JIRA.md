# JIRA

The JIRA integration allows to select a commit message (including JIRA
key) directly from (open) JIRA issues and to optionally mark issues as
resolved on **Commit**.

## Prerequisites

The JIRA integration is only available for the **Professional** edition
and will only be present, if the [Bugtraq properties](Bugtraq-Properties.md) have been set up properly for your JIRA
server.



When connecting to a cloud-based JIRA instance
(\*.[atlassian.net](http://atlassian.net)), you have to login with your
**username**, not your email address. You can find your username in
your **Profile** (top-right corner).



## Commit Message Selection

The commit message selection is available in the **Commit** dialog.
