# Merge from 2 Sources

Use **Modify\|Merge from 2 Sources** to merge changes between two
different merge sources (URLs) to the selected file/directory.

Changes are merged from one **Repository** between **From** and **To**
to the local **Destination**. The last *10* merge sources will be stored
and can be set using the drop-down button beside the **Repository**
drop-down list. For details regarding the **Advanced** options, refer to
[Merge](Merge.md#Merge-commands.merge).


#### Note

>Most merging use cases are covered by
>[Merge](Merge.md#Merge-commands.merge) and if possible this
>command should be used instead.
