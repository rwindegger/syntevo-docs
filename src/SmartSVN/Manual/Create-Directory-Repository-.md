# Create Directory (Repository)

Use **Modify\|Create Directory** to create a new directory in the
currently selected directory. Enter the **Directory Name** which may
contain slashes ('/') to create multiple directories at once.

Select **Create default project structure for trunk, branches and tags**
to also create sub-directories `trunk`, `branches` and `tags` in the
created directory.

Enter the corresponding **Commit Message** which is automatically
suggested, as long as you don't have manually modified it.
