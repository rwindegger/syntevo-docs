# Merge Info

Use **Properties\|Merge Info** to change the `svn:mergeinfo` property
for the selected files/directory.


#### Warning
>
>
>The `svn:mergeinfo` is a core part of Subversion's *merge-tracking*
>mechanisms and is automatically managed by **Modify\|Merge** and related
>commands. If you want to manually 'block' certain revisions from being
>merged, you should use **Modify\|Merge** with the **Record only** option
>set.
