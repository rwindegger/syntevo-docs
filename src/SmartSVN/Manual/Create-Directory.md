# Create Directory

Use **Modify\|Create Directory** to locally create a directory within
the currently selected directory.

Enter the **Path** of the subdirectory that will be created. The path
may consist of multiple directory names, separated by '\\' or '/' to
create multiple directories at once. Select **Schedule for addition** to
schedule the created directory/directories for addition to SVN control,
see [Add](Add.md#Add-commands.add).
