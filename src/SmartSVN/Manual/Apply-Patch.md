# Apply Patch

Use **Modify\|Apply Patch** to apply a *patch file* to your working
copy. Currently supported patch file formats are *unidiff* patches.
See **Create Patch**
([Queries](https://www.syntevo.com/doc/display/SUWIP/Queries)) on how to
create patches with SmartSVN.

Select the **Patch File** to apply and additional options. Typically,
patch files have `.patch` or `.diff` extensions.

The patch will be applied directly to the working copy, so you can
inspect it in all details before finally committing the patch.
