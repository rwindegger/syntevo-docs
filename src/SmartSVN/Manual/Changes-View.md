# Changes View

The **Changes view** displays local changes of the file currently
selected in the file table. More precisely, it displays the differences
between the currently selected file, as found in the working copy, and
the corresponding pristine copy of that file, as found in the
repository.


#### Tip
>
>
>The [Review perspective](Project-Window.md#perspectives)
>is intended to provide enough space for the **Changes** view, so you can
>switch between the Main and Preview perspective instead of resizing the
>**Changes** view.
