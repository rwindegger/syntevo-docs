# Edit Properties (Repository)

Use **Modify\|Edit Properties** to open a dialog that allows you to edit
the SVN properties of the selected file or directory. The dialog is
described in more detail in [Edit Properties](Edit-Properties.md#EditProperties-commands.properties.edit).
Additionally, there is a text field at the bottom where you can enter a
commit message for the property changes to be committed.
