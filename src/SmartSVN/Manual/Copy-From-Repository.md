# Copy From Repository

With **Modify\|Copy From Repository** you can copy a file or directory
from the repository to your local working copy. This command can be used
for recovering deleted files and directories from earlier revisions.

**Repository** is the repository of your local working copy, it can't be
changed as copies can only be performed within the same repository. For
**Copy** enter the file/directory to be copied, along with its **Source
Revision**. Specify the local directory **Into Local** into which the
file/directory should be copied. **With Name** will be the name (i.e.,
last component of the path) of the restored file/directory.
