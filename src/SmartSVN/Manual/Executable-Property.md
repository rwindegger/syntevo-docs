# Executable-Property

Use **Properties\|Executable-Property** to change the
'Executable-Property' of the selected files. The 'Executable-Property'
is a versioned property, but is only used on Unix(-like) platforms,
where it defines whether the 'Executable Flag' should be set to a file
or not.

Choose **Executable** if the 'Executable-Property' should be assigned to
the file or **Non-Executable** to remove the property from the selected
files.
