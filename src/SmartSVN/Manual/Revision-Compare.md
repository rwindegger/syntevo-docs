# Revision Compare

The Revision Compare is an optimized 'multi-file' compare. It gives a
detailed overview of changes within a set of files. A Revision Compare
is for instance invoked by **Query\|Show Changes** from the
[Log](Log.md#Log-log) when having a revision selected. There
are various other ways/windows to invoke a Revision Compare in SmartSVN.

The core component of the Revision Compare is a read-only [File Compare](File-Compare.md#FileCompare-file-compare) view; for
details regarding the usage, refer to
[Comparison](File-Compare.md#comparison).
The upper part of the Revision Compare frame consists of a directory
tree and a file table, which displays the files being part of the
Revision Compare.
