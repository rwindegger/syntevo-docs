# Exclude from Working Copy

Use **Modify\|Exclude from Working Copy** on one or more directories to
locally exclude them from the working copy. The directories won't be
removed from the repository, but will simply be ignored during
subsequent [Updates](Update.md#Update-commands.update). To get
excluded directories back, use the *inverse operation* [Update More](Update-More.md#UpdateMore-commands.update-more) .
