# Commercial-only features

A commercial license is in general required when running SmartGit in a commercial environment, see sections 3.2.1 and 3.2.2 of the [license agreement](https://www.syntevo.com/documents/smartgit-license.html).

A few features of SmartGit are only available when running SmartGit with a commercial license (no guarantee on completeness):

-   [Standard window](https://www.syntevo.com/smartgit/standard-window/)
-   [JIRA Integration](JIRA.md)

-   [Distributed Reviews](Distributed-Reviews-add-on-.md) (require a license add-on, too)
-   DeepGit license included
