# The Repositories View in SmartGit

The *Repositories View* shows a list of repositories known to SmartGit on the local computer, allowing you to open an existing repository, and shows you which repository(ies) are currently open by a **bold** highlight.

Please also refer to [Working with Repositories](Repository/index.md) for general Repository operations.

SmartGit remembers repositories that you've previously opened and any GUI-related settings applied to each repository. To open a repository, double-click it. If the repository is already is open in another window, SmartGit will focus on that window. If the current window executes commands or **Open in New Window** has been selected from the repository's context menu, the repository will open in a new window. To open multiple repositories simultaneously, select and highlight each repository (e.g., using **`Ctrl/Cmd` + click**) and choose **Open** from the context menu.

Repositories can be arranged in groups. Right-click on the repositories and select the target group or **New Group** from the **Move To** submenu. Alternatively, you can use drag-and-drop onto the target group or a repository inside the target group
(see [autoscroll](Tips-and-Tricks.md#autoscrolling-while-drag-and-drop)).

Repositories can be marked as favorites using the **Mark as Favorite** (**Unmark as Favorite**) option. Favorite repositories are indicated with an asterisk (*) after the name and are sorted before non-favorite repositories. Additionally, favorite repositories will receive background refresh operations.
